# Vertex Degrees

````{prf:theorem}
:label: thm:5

The sum of degrees of all vertices
is twice the number of edges in any graph.
That is,

```{math}
\begin{align*}\sum_{v \in V}\deg(v) = 2 \abs{E}\end{align*}
```

````{prf:corollary}
:label: cor:2

The number of vertices of odd degree is even
in any graph.
